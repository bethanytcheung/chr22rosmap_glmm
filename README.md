This repository includes files for making a GLMM (Generalized Linear Mixed Model) with ROSMAP data. 
The following files are regarding data parsing:
    Output data/dependent variables: rosmap read - out, active_e, enhancer_e, methylation_e, repressed_e, transcription_e

        rosmap read - out was used to read the columns and determine data categories as it was difficult to open the unzipped file. 
        The other files following are column files where individual data was extracted from the datasets.

    Input data/independent variables: rosmap read -ind, rosmap transfer - ind
