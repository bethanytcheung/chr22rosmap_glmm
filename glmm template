# notes for glmm format
from statsmodels.formula.api import glm
 model = glm(formula, data, family)
    formual: response ~ explanatory variable(s) - 'y ~ x1 + x2'
             output ~ input(s)
                        - Categorical models = C(x1)
                        - removing intercept = -1
                        - interaction between x1, x2 = x1:x2
                        - interaction between x1, x2, individual variables of ea. = x1*x2
                        - vectorized(?) functions to model variables = np.log(x1)

Family arguments:
- Gaussian = (link = sm.families.links.identity) --> default (other nondefault must be specified)
- Binominal = (link = sm.families.links.logit)
        + probit, cauchy, log, cloglog
- Poisson = (link = sm.families.links.log)
        + identity, sqrt

To only view regression coefficents (i think this is the table thing)
    model_GLM.params
            - .params prints regression coefficents
    model_GLM.conf_int()
            - conf_int(alpha = 0.05, cols = None) prints confidence intervals estimates
                    - default = 95%, can be changed w/ alpha function, cols = which confidence interval u want

To make predictions
- provide model variables and provide test data, or else it will make predictions w/ fit data and that shows nothing
    model_GLM.predict(test_data)
            - .predict(test_data) computes predictions

Cmd + shift + P to change languages !!
